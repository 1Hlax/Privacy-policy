Last Updated: 17-02-2025

1. Introduction
Tajmea is a multi-functional app developed by Ziyad Almutairi, offering essential tools such as a calendar, date converter, age calculator, prayer times, and Qibla direction.
The app name “Tajmea” comes from the Arabic word for “gathering” or “collection,” reflecting the app’s purpose: to bring together multiple useful services in one easy-to-use, free application. The goal is to simplify users’ lives by eliminating the need for multiple separate apps.

3. Data Collection
Tajmea does not collect, store, or share any personal user data on external servers. All stored information remains on the user’s device.
4. Required Permissions
• Location (GPS): Used only for calculating prayer times and Qibla direction. The location data is neither stored nor shared.
• Local Storage: Appointments and settings are saved locally on the user’s device, with no external access.

6. Data Sharing
Tajmea does not share user data with third parties and does not use analytics services such as Google Analytics or Firebase.

8. Ads & Purchases
The app is completely free and does not contain ads or in-app purchases.

10. Security & Privacy
Since the app does not collect data, all stored information remains secure on the user’s device. The developer,
 Ziyad Almutairi, has no access to user data, ensuring complete privacy.

12. Data Deletion
Users can delete their saved appointments or any other data within the app. Since there is no external storage, uninstalling the app permanently removes all stored data.
